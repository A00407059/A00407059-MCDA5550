- DJANGO ASSIGNMENT - A00407059 Jongwon Shinn

- Submitted date: 2022-03-01

- Guideline: Please refer to the above folders for the django assignment. I couldn't deploy on AWS because of configuration issue in RDS.

  You can see the history of migration and the details of code in the folder. GET,POST and connection to RDS works well in local server.

  1. In order to access local server, you need to be in the assignment directory.

  2. python manage.py runserver 

  3. Click the local link in console and add '/hotel_list' in the end.

  4. You can get hotel list as json format and add new list by adding same jason format in the page.
